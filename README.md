# HTCSS Job Event Log to CSV Summarizer

A simple script that reads HTCondor job event logs and outputs a CSV summary of job statistics.

The CSV file can be imported into a spreadsheet application and used to review jobs.
This tool may help when scaling up workloads or running larger workloads.

## Requirements

This script needs the following things:

*   Python 3
*   HTCondor Python bindings
    ([installation instructions](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apis/python-bindings/install.html))

## Usage

Run `logs2csv -h` for usage information.

## Notes

**Caution:**
There is [a known bug in HTCondor](https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-1263)
that results in some values for a jobâ€™s requested disk being incorrect.
In particular, if the amount of requested disk (in KB) exceeds 7 digits,
the value is truncated **on the left**, which makes it look like much less disk was requested.
So trust your submit files for the correct `request_disk` value!
